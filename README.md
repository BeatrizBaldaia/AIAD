# AIAD

We built a Multi-Agent System, ran agent-based simulations, and analyzed the data of the ran simulations.


### Software

 - **Repast Simphony** for the graphical interface, and for running the agent-based simulations
 - **JADE** for building the agent system
 - **[SAJaS](https://web.fe.up.pt/~hlc/doku.php?id=sajas)**, the bridge between Reapst Simphony and JADE
  - **RapidMiner** for data analysis
